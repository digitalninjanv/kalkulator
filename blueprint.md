# Project Blueprint

## Overview

This document outlines the plan for redesigning a calculator application with a modern, neumorphic user interface. The goal is to create a visually appealing, intuitive, and feature-rich calculator that provides an exceptional user experience.

## Features

### Core Functionality

- **Basic Arithmetic Operations:** Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Advanced Calculations:** Percentage and sign toggle.
- **Input Handling:** Dynamic expression and result display.

### User Interface (UI)

- **Neumorphic Design:** A modern, soft UI with a tactile feel, where elements emerge from the background.
- **Responsive Layout:** The layout will adapt seamlessly to portrait, landscape, and tablet screen sizes.
- **Color-Coded Buttons:**
  - **Operators:** Orange
  - **Clear/Delete:** Red
  - **Equals:** Blue
  - **Numbers:** White/Black (depending on the theme)
- **Interactive Feedback:** Buttons will have a ripple effect and haptic feedback.
- **History Tracking:**
  - **Inline Mini-History:** A small, scrollable history view will be visible on the main screen.
  - **Full History Panel:** A more detailed history panel will be accessible via a swipe-up gesture.
- **Theming:**
  - **Light Mode:** A bright, clean interface.
  - **Dark Mode:** A high-contrast, dark interface for low-light environments.

## Technical Implementation

- **State Management:** `provider` package for managing the calculator's state.
- **UI Components:** Custom-built neumorphic widgets.
- **Theming:** Centralized theme management for light and dark modes.
- **Dependencies:**
  - `provider`
  - `google_fonts`
  - `haptic_feedback`

## Current Plan

The current focus is on implementing the neumorphic UI redesign, including the following steps:

1.  **Project Setup:** Add necessary dependencies (`google_fonts`, `haptic_feedback`).
2.  **Theming:** Define the light and dark color schemes and text styles.
3.  **UI Scaffolding:** Create the main calculator screen with a responsive layout.
4.  **Neumorphic Widgets:** Build custom widgets for the calculator buttons and display.
5.  **State Integration:** Connect the UI to the `CalculatorLogic` state management class.
6.  **History Feature:** Implement the inline and full history views.
7.  **Final Touches:** Add animations, refine the layout, and ensure a polished user experience.
