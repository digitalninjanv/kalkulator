# Application Blueprint

## Overview

This document outlines the structure, design, and features of the Flutter application. Its purpose is to create a stable, efficient, and high-performance application with a modern and visually appealing user interface.

## Current State Analysis

The initial project is a standard Flutter counter app. To improve it, I will perform the following actions:
- **Code Refactoring:** Enhance code quality and readability.
- **State Management:** Implement a robust solution for managing application state.
- **UI/UX Modernization:** Update the user interface to follow Material Design 3 principles.
- **Performance Optimization:** Apply best practices to ensure the app runs smoothly.

## Plan for Improvement

1.  **Add Dependencies:** Include necessary packages for state management and modern typography (`provider`, `google_fonts`).
2.  **Implement Theme Management:**
    *   Create a `ThemeProvider` class to manage light and dark modes.
    *   Define `ThemeData` for both light and dark themes using `ColorScheme.fromSeed` for a Material 3 look.
    *   Incorporate custom fonts using `google_fonts`.
3.  **Refactor the Main Application:**
    *   Wrap the application in a `ChangeNotifierProvider` to make the theme state available throughout the widget tree.
    *   Update `MyApp` to consume the `ThemeProvider` and apply the correct theme.
4.  **Enhance the Home Page:**
    *   Rebuild `MyHomePage` to demonstrate the new theme and state management.
    *   Add a theme toggle button to the `AppBar`.
    *   Showcase themed widgets and custom fonts.
5.  **Code Cleanup and Verification:**
    *   Run `dart format .` to ensure consistent code style.
    *   Run `flutter analyze` to identify and fix any potential issues.

This plan will establish a solid foundation for a scalable and maintainable Flutter application.
